# KirkaScripts

This is a list of userscripts from Sheriff. All were made by me and they will be auto-updated. I got the unobfuscated userscripts in a private repo.

# How to use:
-  [Downloads BKC (Better-Kirka-Client)](https://github.com/42infi/better-kirka-client/releases)
- Select the userscripts you want
- Go to Documents > BetterKirkaClient > scripts
- Create a .txt file
- Rename it however you like
- Paste the code of the userscript into it
- Click "File" > save as > then at the file format you select "All types"
- Rename the file to a .js file and click save
- Restart BKC/Press F4

# Userscripts:
- [inventory calculator: Shows how much your inventory is worth](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SheriffCarry/KirkaScripts/main/Userscript/inventory_calculator.js)

# Scripts that are probably ToS, but not confirmed
- Skinchanger (stays private)
- Cords (shows your own position in the "FPS/Ping menu"
- Autoclaim (claims quests + skips ad automatically)
- Streamsnipe script (helps you streamsnipe people lol)

# Scripts I have that violate the Kirka ToS.
The userscripts stay private
- Alt manager (easily lets you swap the account)
- Spectatorcount (shows how many spectators are in your game)
- Bots (they will go into your game and stay afk)
