# KirkaScripts

This is a list of userscripts from Sheriff. All were made by me and they will be auto-updated. I got the unobfuscated userscripts in a private repo.
### Script Requests
Discord: CarrySheriff#4911
### My todo
- Clan lookup (view other clan pages)
- Improve tradingprices (shows easily if profit/loss for trades)
- Add [yzzz.mtz](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VqX9kwJx0WlHWKCJNGyIQe33APdUSXz0hEFk6x2-3bU/edit#gid=0)'s price list to inventory (for selling & to market for buying)
##### Requested Stuff:
- Show price in inventory
- Show total amount of available quests, availabe exp, availabe coins (daily & hourly)
- Kirka "bundles" estimated selling prices
- Current prices for market items (maybe highlight skins that are cheaper/more expensive then est price)
- Clan page show score per week (information for me: it will be average)
- Ingame score & killstreak field
