# KirkaScripts

This is a list of userscripts from Sheriff. All were made by me and they will be auto-updated. I got the unobfuscated userscripts in a private repo.

# How to use:
-  [Downloads BKC (Better-Kirka-Client)](https://github.com/42infi/better-kirka-client/releases)
- Select the userscripts you want
- Go to Documents > BetterKirkaClient > scripts
- Create a .txt file
- Rename it however you like
- Paste the code of the userscript into it
- Click "File" > save as > then at the file format you select "All types"
- Rename the file to a .js file and click save
- Restart BKC/Press F4
